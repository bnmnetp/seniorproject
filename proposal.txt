Our proposal is to create a web application that allows Luther students to participate in room draw online. This would just be for the main registration event, including single+double+triple rooms in Towers, etc. (i.e. everything except for Farwell, Baker, etc.). This would function very similarly to registering for classes, where students have a "registration window" based on their room draw number. They would then select a room via a nice UI based on floor plans (like how it currently works on paper). We also plan on having pre-selection options (like how registering on my.luther works) as well as possibly an auto-register system for if a student cannot by any means be available during his/her registration time. We have spoken to Res Life and they are open to the idea, which means this has the potential to be actually integrated with Luther room draw.
